        <p>Please see our information pages on Ethics in publishing and Ethical guidelines for journal publication.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="declarationofinterest">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Declaration of Interest</h6>
        <p>All authors must disclose any financial and personal relationships with other people or organizations that could inappropriately influence (bias) their work. Examples of potential competing interests include employment, consultancies, stock ownership, honoraria, paid expert testimony, patent applications/registrations, and grants or other funding. Authors must disclose any interests in two places: 1. A summary declaration of interest statement in the title page file (if double-blind) or the manuscript file (if single-blind). If there are no interests to declare then please state this: 'Declarations of interest: none'. This summary statement will be ultimately published if the article is accepted. 2. Detailed disclosures as part of a separate Declaration of Interest form, which forms part of the journal's official records. It is important for potential interests to be declared in both places and that the information matches. More information.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="submissiondeclaration">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Submission declaration and verification</h6>
        <p>Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract, a published lecture or academic thesis, see 'Multiple, redundant or concurrent publication' for more information), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that, if accepted, it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, including electronically without the written consent of the copyright-holder. To verify originality, your article may be checked by the originality detection service Crossref Similarity Check.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="inclusivelanguage">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Use of Inclusive language</h6>
        <p>Inclusive language acknowledges diversity, conveys respect to all people, is sensitive to differences, and promotes equal opportunities. Content should make no assumptions about the beliefs or commitments of any reader; contain nothing which might imply that one individual is superior to another on the grounds of age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability or health condition; and use inclusive language throughout. Authors should ensure that writing is free from bias, stereotypes, slang, reference to dominant culture and/or cultural assumptions. We advise to seek gender neutrality by using plural nouns ("clinicians, patients/clients") as default/wherever possible to avoid using "he, she," or "he/she." We recommend avoiding the use of descriptors that refer to personal attributes such as age, gender, race, ethnicity, culture, sexual orientation, disability or health condition unless they are relevant and valid. These guidelines are meant as a point of reference to help identify appropriate language but are by no means exhaustive or definitive.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="authorcontributions">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Author Contributions</h6>
        <p>For transparency, we encourage authors to submit an author statement file outlining their individual contributions to the paper using the relevant CRediT roles: Conceptualization; Data curation; Formal analysis; Funding acquisition; Investigation; Methodology; Project administration; Resources; Software; Supervision; Validation; Visualization; Roles/Writing - original draft; Writing - review & editing. Authorship statements should be formatted with the names of authors first and CRediT role(s) following. More details and an example</p>
        </div>
        <div id="changestoauthorship">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Changes to Authorship</h6>
        <p>Authors are expected to consider carefully the list and order of authors before submitting their manuscript and provide the definitive list of authors at the time of the original submission. Any addition, deletion or rearrangement of author names in the authorship list should be made only before the manuscript has been accepted and only if approved by the journal Editor. To request such a change, the Editor must receive the following from the corresponding author: (a) the reason for the change in author list and (b) written confirmation (e-mail, letter) from all authors that they agree with the addition, removal or rearrangement. In the case of addition or removal of authors, this includes confirmation from the author being added or removed.
Only in exceptional circumstances will the Editor consider the addition, deletion or rearrangement of authors after the manuscript has been accepted. While the Editor considers the request, publication of the manuscript will be suspended. If the manuscript has already been published in an online issue, any requests approved by the Editor will result in a corrigendum.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="copyright">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Copyright</h6>
        <p>Upon acceptance of an article, authors will be asked to complete a 'Journal Publishing Agreement' (see more information on this). An e-mail will be sent to the corresponding author confirming receipt of the manuscript together with a 'Journal Publishing Agreement' form or a link to the online version of this agreement.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="authorrights">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Author rights</h6>

        <p>Find out how you can share your research published in Elsevier journals.
        Please write your text in good English (American or British usage is accepted, but not a mixture of these). Authors who feel their English language manuscript may require editing to eliminate possible grammatical or spelling errors and to conform to correct scientific English may wish to use the English Language Editing service available from Elsevier's Author Services.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="submission">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Submission</h6>
        <p>Our online submission system guides you stepwise through the process of entering your article details and uploading your files. The system converts your article files to a single PDF file used in the peer-review process. Editable files (e.g., Word, LaTeX) are required to typeset your article for final publication. All correspondence, including notification of the Editor's decision and requests for revision, is sent by e-mail.
        </p>
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Referees</h6>
        <p>Please submit the names and institutional e-mail addresses of several potential referees. For more details, visit our Support site. Note that the editor retains the sole right to decide whether or not the suggested reviewers are used.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="preparation">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">preparation</h6>
        <p>Please ensure the figures and the tables included in the single file are placed next to the relevant text in the manuscript, rather than at the bottom or the top of the file. The corresponding caption should be placed directly below the figure or table.
        </p>
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Referees</h6>
        <p>Please submit the names and institutional e-mail addresses of several potential referees. For more details, visit our Support site. Note that the editor retains the sole right to decide whether or not the suggested reviewers are used.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="peerreview">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Peer Review</h6>
        <p>This journal operates a single anonymized review process. All contributions will be initially assessed by the editor for suitability for the journal. Papers deemed suitable are then typically sent to a minimum of two independent expert reviewers to assess the scientific quality of the paper. The Editor is responsible for the final decision regarding acceptance or rejection of articles. The Editor's decision is final. Editors are not involved in decisions about papers which they have written themselves or have been written by family members or colleagues or which relate to products or services in which the editor has an interest. Any such submission is subject to all of the journal's usual procedures, with peer review handled independently of the relevant editor and their research groups. More information on types of peer review.
        </p>
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Use of word processing software</h6>
        <p>It is important that the file be saved in the native format of the word processor used. The text should be in single-column format. Keep the layout of the text as simple as possible. Most formatting codes will be removed and replaced on processing the article. In particular, do not use the word processor's options to justify text or to hyphenate words. However, do use bold face, italics, subscripts, superscripts etc. When preparing tables, if you are using a table grid, use only one grid for each individual table and not a grid for each row. If no grid is used, use tabs, not spaces, to align columns. The electronic text should be prepared in a way very similar to that of conventional manuscripts (see also the Guide to Publishing with Elsevier). Note that source files of figures, tables and text graphics will be required whether or not you embed your figures in the text. See also the section on Electronic artwork.
        To avoid unnecessary errors you are strongly advised to use the 'spell-check' and 'grammar-check' functions of your word processor.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="articlestructure">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Article structure</h6>
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Subdivision - numbered section</h6>
        <p>Divide your article into clearly defined and numbered sections. Subsections should be numbered 1.1 (then 1.1.1, 1.1.2, ...), 1.2, etc. (the abstract is not included in section numbering). Use this numbering also for internal cross-referencing: do not just refer to 'the text'. Any subsection may be given a brief heading. Each heading should appear on its own separate line.
        </p>
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Introduction</h6>
        <p>State the objectives of the work and provide an adequate background, avoiding a detailed literature survey or a summary of the results.
        </p>
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Materials and methods</h6>
        <p>Provide sufficient details to allow the work to be reproduced by an independent researcher. Methods that are already published should be summarized, and indicated by a reference. If quoting directly from a previously published method, use quotation marks and also cite the source. Any modifications to existing methods should also be described.
        </p>
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Theory/Calculations</h6>
        <p>A Theory section should extend, not repeat, the background to the article already dealt with in the Introduction and lay the foundation for further work. In contrast, a Calculation section represents a practical development from a theoretical basis.
        </p>
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Results</h6>
        <p>Results should be clear and concise.
        </p>
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Discussion</h6>
        <p>This should explore the significance of the results of the work, not repeat them. A combined Results and Discussion section is often appropriate. Avoid extensive citations and discussion of published literature.
        </p>
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Appendics</h6>
        <p>If there is more than one appendix, they should be identified as A, B, etc. Formulae and equations in appendices should be given separate numbering: Eq. (A.1), Eq. (A.2), etc.; in a subsequent appendix, Eq. (B.1) and so on. Similarly for tables and figures: Table A.1; Fig. A.1, etc.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div id="essentialtitlepageinformation">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Essential title page information</h6>
        <li><b><i>Title. </i></b>Concise and informative. Titles are often used in information-retrieval systems. Avoid abbreviations and formulae where possible.</li>
        <li><b><i>Author names and affiliations. </i></b> Please clearly indicate the given name(s) and family name(s) of each author and check that all names are accurately spelled. You can add your name between parentheses in your own script behind the English transliteration. Present the authors' affiliation addresses (where the actual work was done) below the names. Indicate all affiliations with a lower-case superscript letter immediately after the author's name and in front of the appropriate address. Provide the full postal address of each affiliation, including the country name and, if available, the e-mail address of each author.</li>
        <li><b><i>Corresponding author. </i></b> Clearly indicate who will handle correspondence at all stages of refereeing and publication, also post-publication. This responsibility includes answering any future queries about Methodology and Materials. Ensure that the e-mail address is given and that contact details are kept up to date by the corresponding author.</li>
        <li><b><i>Present/permanent address. </i></b>  If an author has moved since the work described in the article was done, or was visiting at the time, a 'Present address' (or 'Permanent address') may be indicated as a footnote to that author's name. The address at which the author actually did the work must be retained as the main, affiliation address. Superscript Arabic numerals are used for such footnotes.</li>
        </div>
        <div id="abstract">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Abstract</h6>
        <p>A concise and factual abstract is required. The abstract should state briefly the purpose of the research, the principal results and major conclusions. An abstract is often presented separately from the article, so it must be able to stand alone. For this reason, References should be avoided, but if essential, then cite the author(s) and year(s). Also, non-standard or uncommon abbreviations should be avoided, but if essential they must be defined at their first mention in the abstract itself.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="keywords">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Keywords</h6>
        <p>Immediately after the abstract, provide a maximum of 6 keywords, using American spelling and avoiding general and plural terms and multiple concepts (avoid, for example, 'and', 'of'). Be sparing with abbreviations: only abbreviations firmly established in the field may be eligible. These keywords will be used for indexing purposes.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="abbreviations">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Abbreviations</h6>
        <p>Define abbreviations that are not standard in this field in a footnote to be placed on the first page of the article. Such abbreviations that are unavoidable in the abstract must be defined at their first mention there, as well as in the footnote. Ensure consistency of abbreviations throughout the article.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="acknowledgement">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Acknowledgement</h6>
        <p>Collate acknowledgements in a separate section at the end of the article before the references and do not, therefore, include them on the title page, as a footnote to the title or otherwise. List here those individuals who provided help during the research (e.g., providing language help, writing assistance or proof reading the article, etc.)</p>
        </div>
        <div id="mathformulae">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Math Formulae</h6>
        <p>Please submit math equations as editable text and not as images. Present simple formulae in line with normal text where possible and use the solidus (/) instead of a horizontal line for small fractional terms, e.g., X/Y. In principle, variables are to be presented in italics. Powers of e are often more conveniently denoted by exp. Number consecutively any equations that have to be displayed separately from the text (if referred to explicitly in the text).</p>
        </div>
        <div id="footnotes">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Footnotes</h6>
        <p>Footnotes should be used sparingly. Number them consecutively throughout the article. Many word processors can build footnotes into the text, and this feature may be used. Otherwise, please indicate the position of footnotes in the text and list the footnotes themselves separately at the end of the article. Do not include footnotes in the Reference list.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="artwork">
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;">Artwork</h6>
        <h6 style="font-weight:bold;"><i>Electronic Artwork</i></h6>
        <li> Make sure you use uniform lettering and sizing of your original artwork.</li>
        <li> Embed the used fonts if the application provides that option.</li>
        <li> Aim to use the following fonts in your illustrations: Arial, Courier, Times New Roman, Symbol, or use fonts that look similar.</li>
        <li> Number the illustrations according to their sequence in the text.</li>
        <li> Use a logical naming convention for your artwork files.</li>
        <li>Provide captions to illustrations separately.</li>
        <li> Size the illustrations close to the desired dimensions of the published version.</li>
        <li>Submit each illustration as a separate file.</li>
        <li> Ensure that color images are accessible to all, including those with impaired color vision.</li>
        <P>
        A detailed guide on electronic artwork is available.
You are urged to visit this site; some excerpts from the detailed information are given here.

        <p>Please make sure that artwork files are in an acceptable format (TIFF (or JPEG), EPS (or PDF) or MS Office files) and with the correct resolution. If, together with your accepted article, you submit usable color figures then Elsevier will ensure, at no additional charge, that these figures will appear in color online (e.g., ScienceDirect and other sites) in addition to color reproduction in print. Further information on the preparation of electronic artwork.</p>
        <h6 id="tables" style="font-weight:bold;"><i>Tables</i></h6>
        <p>Please submit tables as editable text and not as images. Tables can be placed either next to the relevant text in the article, or on separate page(s) at the end. Number tables consecutively in accordance with their appearance in the text and place any table notes below the table body. Be sparing in the use of tables and ensure that the data presented in them do not duplicate results described elsewhere in the article. Please avoid using vertical rules and shading in table cells.</p>
        <h6 id="figurecaptions" style="font-weight:bold;"><i>Figure captions</i></h6>
        <p>Ensure that each illustration has a caption. Supply captions separately, not attached to the figure. A caption should comprise a brief title (not on the figure itself) and a description of the illustration. Keep text in the illustrations themselves to a minimum but explain all symbols and abbreviations used.</p>
        <div>
        <h6 id="references" style="font-weight:bold;"><i>References</i></h6>
        <h6  style="font-weight:bold;"><i>Citation in text</i></h6>
        <p>Please ensure that every reference cited in the text is also present in the reference list (and vice versa). Any references cited in the abstract must be given in full. Unpublished results and personal communications are not recommended in the reference list, but may be mentioned in the text. If these references are included in the reference list they should follow the standard reference style of the journal and should include a substitution of the publication date with either 'Unpublished results' or 'Personal communication'. Citation of a reference as 'in press' implies that the item has been accepted for publication.</p>
        <h6  style="font-weight:bold;"><i>Web references</i></h6>
        <p>As a minimum, the full URL should be given and the date when the reference was last accessed. Any further information, if known (DOI, author names, dates, reference to a source publication, etc.), should also be given. Web references can be listed separately (e.g., after the reference list) under a different heading if desired, or can be included in the reference list.</p>
        <h6  style="font-weight:bold;"><i>References in a special issue</i></h6>
        <p>Please ensure that the words 'this issue' are added to any references in the list (and any citations in the text) to other articles in the same Special Issue.</p>
        <h6  style="font-weight:bold;"><i>Reference management software</i></h6>
        <p>Most Elsevier journals have their reference template available in many of the most popular reference management software products. These include all products that support Citation Style Language styles, such as Mendeley. Using citation plug-ins from these products, authors only need to select the appropriate journal template when preparing their article, after which citations and bibliographies will be automatically formatted in the journal's style. If no template is yet available for this journal, please follow the format of the sample references and citations as shown in this Guide. If you use reference management software, please ensure that you remove all field codes before submitting the electronic manuscript. More information on how to remove field codes from different reference management software.

        Users of Mendeley Desktop can easily install the reference style for this journal by clicking the following link:
        http://open.mendeley.com/use-citation-style/alexandria-engineering-journal
        When preparing your manuscript, you will then be able to select this style using the Mendeley plug-ins for Microsoft Word or LibreOffice.</p>
        <h6  style="font-weight:bold;"><i>Reference Style</i></h6>
        <p>Text: Indicate references by number(s) in square brackets in line with the text. The actual authors can be referred to, but the reference number(s) must always be given.
        Example: "..... as demonstrated [3,6]. Barnaby and Jones [8] obtained a different result ...."
        List: Number the references (numbers in square brackets) in the list in the order in which they appear in the text.
        Examples:
       1- J. van der Geer, J.A.J. Hanraads, R.A. Lupton, The art of writing a scientific article, J. Sci. Commun. 163 (2000) 51–59.

        <h6 id="onlineproofcorrection" style="font-weight:bold;">Online proof correction</h6>
        <p>To ensure a fast publication process of the article, we kindly ask authors to provide us with their proof corrections within two days. Corresponding authors will receive an e-mail with a link to our online proofing system, allowing annotation and correction of proofs online. The environment is similar to MS Word: in addition to editing text, you can also comment on figures/tables and answer questions from the Copy Editor. Web-based proofing provides a faster and less error-prone process by allowing you to directly type your corrections, eliminating the potential introduction of errors.
        If preferred, you can still choose to annotate and upload your edits on the PDF version. All instructions for proofing will be given in the e-mail we send to authors, including alternative methods to the online version and PDF.
        We will do everything possible to get your article published quickly and accurately. Please use this proof only for checking the typesetting, editing, completeness and correctness of the text, tables and figures. Significant changes to the article as accepted for publication will only be considered at this stage with permission from the Editor. It is important to ensure that all corrections are sent back to us in one communication. Please check carefully before replying, as inclusion of any subsequent corrections cannot be guaranteed. Proofreading is solely your responsibility.</p>
